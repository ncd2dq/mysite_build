#A virtual environment is an entirely independent bundle of libraries
so that you can control what libraries are used for your project.

For example, a new library might break backwards compatibility, so you
would not want a new library installation to automatically be applied to your project.


Make a project directory:
-mkdir myproject
-cd myproject

When inside directory, make a virtual environment
-python -m venv venv

Then you need to activate the virtual environment
-venv\Scripts\activate

install Flask within the virtual env
-pip install Flask

as long as you see (venv) you are in the virtual env



###Bash is basically mac/linux
