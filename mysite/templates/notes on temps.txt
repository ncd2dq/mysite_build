The jinja library is used with Flask and it auto escapes any data
that is rendered in the HTML templates

this means it's safe t render user input as any values that could mess with HTML
are auto escaped but look the same in the users browser

{{ }} encapsulates expressions that will be output to the final document
{% %} denotes control flow statements like IF and FOR

unlike python, blocks are denoted by start and end tags rather than indentation
this is because static text within a block could change indentation
